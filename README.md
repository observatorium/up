# UP

UP is a simple client that makes Prometheus remote-write requests.
The client writes the specified metric at the chosen interval.
The value of the metric will always be the current timestamp in milliseconds.

It can also read the value back and compare it against the current time.
If the duration is greater than 0s, it will evaluate number of errors and success
in the given duration against a percentage threshold and exit with zero or non-zero.

[![Build Status](https://cloud.drone.io/api/badges/observatorium/up/status.svg)](https://cloud.drone.io/observatorium/up)

## Getting Started

The easiest way to begin making remote write requests is to run the UP container.
For example, to report an `up` metric every 10 seconds, run:

```shell
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 quay.io/observatorium/up --endpoint=https://example.com/api/v1/receive --period=10s
```

Note that the metric name and labels are customizable.
For example, to report a metric named `foo` with a custom `bar` label, run:

```shell
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 quay.io/observatorium/up --endpoint=https://example.com/api/v1/receive --period=10s --name foo --labels 'bar="baz"'
```
